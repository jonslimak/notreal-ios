# Progress Log

## 2026-02-09
- Initialized shared-memory workflow for this project.
- Added task tracking file and project index entry.
- Next step: run $start to set priorities, risks, and next actions.
- Completed planning pass and documented MVP scope/architecture in `plan.md`.
- Locked sprint-based plan, launch risk gate, and core funnel analytics events.
- Next step: run one final planning review before implementation docs.
- Final planning review completed and approved updates were applied to `plan.md`.
- Added compliance must-haves, security baseline, analytics operating model, expanded IAP test matrix, and acceptance criteria.
- Expanded `plan.md` with project context at the top and a combined implementation architecture + build order section.
- Created `analytics-spec.md` and `launch-checklist.md`, and referenced both from the implementation section in `plan.md`.
- Ran a cross-doc consistency pass and applied fixes for sprint-only wording, analytics property definitions, and checklist alignment.
- Created UI mockups at `mockups/v1-screens.html`. Four screens: Player, Home, Paywall, Profile.
- Key UX decisions made during mockup process:
  - App opens directly into the Player (episode 1) — no onboarding screen.
  - Only 1-2 shows at launch, so no search/discovery/library tabs.
  - Home screen: one big hero banner for the flagship show + Coming Soon tiles + floating "Jump back in" toast for returning users.
  - Player: full-screen 9:16 vertical video, swipe up to advance, close button exits to Home.
  - Paywall: triggered at episode gate (ep 6+), yearly plan pre-selected, App Store compliant copy.
  - Profile: accessed via icon on Home (no tab bar), guest state default, Sign in with Apple, delete account.
  - No bottom tab bar — simplified nav with profile icon in top-right of Home.
- Mockup HTML includes embedded design notes per screen and a docs drawer showing plan/progress/tasks.
- Next step: begin Stage 1 implementation. The implementing agent should read `mockups/v1-screens.html` for UI reference.
